Helmet detection using **YOLOv8l** is an advanced computer vision approach to identify whether a person is wearing a helmet in images or video streams. The process begins with **dataset preparation**, where images are collected and annotated with labels such as "helmet" and "no helmet." The **YOLOv8l** model, a large variant of the YOLOv8 family, is then selected for its high accuracy and efficiency. The model is trained using labeled data with Ultralytics' YOLO framework, optimizing it for real-time detection. Once trained, the model is deployed to perform **inference**, detecting helmets in real-world scenarios such as traffic monitoring or workplace safety. Finally, performance evaluation and **fine-tuning** are conducted by adjusting confidence thresholds and non-max suppression settings to enhance detection accuracy. This approach ensures robust and efficient helmet detection for various safety applications.
